    /**Attaching the javascript file to html file:**
    
    We can attach the js file with html file in 2 ways.
    
    1.Internal Way
    
    2.External Way
    
    1.Internal Way
    
    By writing the code of javascript inside <script></script>tag
    
    Syntax:
    
    <head>
    
                <script>
    
                     //javascript code
    
                 </script>
    
    </head>
    
    2.External Way
    
    1. To write javascript externally to html file, we need to create an external javascript file with extension as .js (ex: index.js)
    2. After that link that javascript file to the html by using script tag.
    
    Example:
    
    <body>
    
               <script    src=””></script>
    
    </body>
    
    **Printing Statements in javascript:**
    
    In javascript we have 2 types of printing statements
    
    1.document.write();  //  it will print the content in window
    
    2.console.log();  //  it will print the content in the console window
